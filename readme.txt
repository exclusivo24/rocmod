About ROCmod
-------------------
ROCmod is an admin mod for SOF2. It is similar to existing mods such as OSP
and Sneaky, but the intent in creating ROCmod was to take the best features
from all admin mods and combine them into a single "ultimate admin" mod, with
many additional features thrown in as well. ROCmod is well on its way to
achieving this goal, and already contains an impressive list of features and
options for both server admins and players.

ROCmod is not a weapon mod, and should not be mistaken as one. ROCmod does not
modify the weapons and damage properties of weapons within SOF2. Servers are
free to use (or not use) any damage configuration they wish with ROCmod.


ROCmod includes the following features:

- All mod features can be configured
- Both client/server and server-only modes
- Admin users, with a huge set of commands available
- Sysop "super admin" users, with many admin management features such
  as sysop immunity and detailed admin command restrictions
- Referee users, temporary admins with limited powers
- Clan members, with special scrim management commands
- Client-side admin control center
- Many admin punishment commands and settings
- Team management commands for shuffling, swapping, and evening teams
- Many scrim features such as team/spec locking and admin suspending
- Match mode, for quickly organizing scrims and matches in a predictable
  and fair environment
- Match moderators, to safely referee matches and scrims
- Configurable admin rcon access

- Penalty box, with automatic punishment for team killing, spawn killing,
  and flag stealing

Installation
-------------------
Installation for Servers:  
1.  Download the ROCmod server zip either from http://rocmod.rocclan.com or
    http://www.sof2files.com
2.  Unzip the entire contents to your server's SOF2 folder (this will create
    a "rocmod" folder within the SOF2 folder)
3.  Add +set fs_game rocmod to your command line (startup script or batch file)
4.  Run your server!

Installation for Clients:
1. Connect to a ROCMOD server and have Autodownloading ON
2. OR go to http://rocmod.rocclan.com and Download the client files and place
   them in a folder you create in your SOF2 Folder named "rocmod" without the
   quotes.

Obviously the easier way is to just connect to a server running the RocMod.
