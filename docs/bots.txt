Although bots are enabled in ROCmod, they are unsupported, buggy, and are
known to occasionally cause the server to crash. It is not recommended
that you use them on public servers or for any length of time.

ROCmod is a multiplayer mod, and it is unlikely the bots will be overhauled
to make them playable. There are entire mods dedicated to bots, and it
would be a huge undertaking.

To use the bots, you will need botfiles and botroutes folders from another
mod such as Mandown or Goldrush. Put these folders in your rocmod folder.
