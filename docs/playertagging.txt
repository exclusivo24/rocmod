Player tagging allows you to tag, or mark, multiple players, allowing you to
perform admin commands on all of them at once. For example, rather than slowly
moving every player from a particular clan to a certain team, you can instead
tag them all at once by their clan tag, and move them all with a single
command.

Players are tagged with the "tag" command, and can be tagged either by their
player ID, or by a string of text in their name. For example:

/adm tag 8

Will tag player 8, adding him to the list of tagged players, while:

/adm tag RoC

Will tag all players with the text "RoC" in their name, such as their clan
tags.

Each "tag" command will add the tagged players to the existing list of tagged
players.

You may then run a command on all tagged players by using the #x or #X command
tokens (see the tokens.txt file for info on command tokens). For example:

/adm forceteam #x blue

Will move all tagged players to the blue team, or:

/adm mute #X

Will mute/unmute all tagged players.

The only difference between the #x and #X tokens is the #X token will clear
the existing player tags after use. Once a command has been performed on a
group of tagged players, the tags are cleared. To perform an additional
command on a group of players, they will have to be re-tagged. This is not the
case with the #x token, allowing you to perform multiple commands on a set of
players.

You may additionally manage the list of tagged players through the following
commands:

/adm swaptags
 Reverses the players that are or are not tagged. Players that were tagged are
 no longer tagged, and previously untagged players are now tagged.

/adm cleartags
 Clears all player tags, allowing you to start fresh.
