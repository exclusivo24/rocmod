Voice commands are configured using the voicecmds.cfg file. You may include
this file with the server in the rocmod folder, or you can put it in a pk3
file along with any new sound files you have added to it.

The cfg file is only used by the server, however all clients will need to
download any of the new sounds that are not already a part of the game. The
ROC media pack is a good example to follow for creating your own sound pk3
file. A default cfg file is left on the server, and an updated cfg file
using the new sounds is included in the pk3 file along with the sounds. That
way, if the sound pk3 file is present, it will be used, otherwise the default
will be used, and there will be no "missing sound" errors.

The following options may be used in the cfg file:
	<command number> sound "path of sound file"
	<command number> text "Text to display"
	<command number> notext "display note"
	<command number> sysoponly
	<command number> adminonly
	<command number> refereeonly
	<command number> clanonly

For example, the following lines would create the @52 voice command:
	52 sound "sound/npc/col8/washington/takingnames.mp3"
	52 text "Kickin' ass and takin' names!"


In addition to the numbered voice commands, there is also a set of internal
voice commands used by the mod itself, for things such as headshots, killing
sprees, etc. These internal voice commands start with a single letter rather
than a number, so there is no conflict with existing voice commands.

Note that many of the internal voice commands are sound-only. Any text you
define for them will be ignored. Here is a list of the currently defined
internal voice commands letters which you may use in your voicecmds.cfg file:

a = Headshot
b = Killing spree - Spree (sound only)
c = Killing spree - Rampage (sound only)
d = Killing spree - Dominating (sound only)
e = Killing spree - Unstoppable (sound only)
f = Killing spree - Godlike (sound only)
g = Killing Spree - Cheating (sound only)
h = Last player on team (INF/ELIM) (sound only)
i = First blood (sound only)
j = Weapon shot out of hand
k = Humiliation melee kill
l = 5 minute warning
m = 3 minute warning
n = 1 minute warning
o = Sudden death warning
p = End of killing spree (sound only)
q = New vote started (sound only)
r = Vote passed (sound only)
s = Vote failed (sound only)


Below are the standard voice commands that come with the mod. Editing the
standard voice commands is not recommended, as it could confuse existing
players who have their binds set.
