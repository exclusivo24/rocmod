There are a number of small features that exist in RoC mod, but which don't
fit into any existing documentation category. I will attempt to keep this
file updated to list them. None of these features are critical, merely
conveniences.

1. Sound-only voice commands
   Normally, you access voice commands using the @ symbol, followed by a
   number representing the voice command you wish to use. For example, @12
   will display the text "Hello", accompanied by a matching sound.
   
   There are times, however, when you would prefer to write your own text for
   the voice command. In this case, you may use the & symbol instead, to use
   only the sound portion of the voice command. For example, &12 will play the
   same sound as @12, but without any text, allowing you to write anything you
   wish to go with it.

2. Ghost mode
   It is very common to switch to spectator to watch a player you think is
   acting suspiciously. However, many players have caught on to this, and
   notice when an admin switches to spectator.
   
   An alternative is to spectate the player while you are dead and waiting to
   respawn. You are still on a team, you just appear dead. Normally this only
   gives you a few seconds, but if you have g_allowAdminGhost enabled, and
   your admin status is not suspended, there is a way to freeze your respawn
   indefinitely. Just hit the "walk" key on your keyboard (whichever key you
   use to switch between running and walking, the default being shift). This
   will toggle you into ghost mode, where you can spectate players as long as
   you like, all the while just appearing dead on your team. Hit the key again
   to resume the respawn countdown.
