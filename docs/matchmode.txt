Match mode allows you to put the server in a known preconfigured state to
speed up and organize scrims and matches.

When match mode is enabled, the game is paused, and waits until all players
have "clicked in" to mark themselves as ready. Once all players are ready,
the map restarts, and the match begins.

While the match is running, there are several settings and cvars which are
in effect, overriding the existing server settings. These settings can not
be overridden during the match. Once match mode has been disabled, all
settings and cvars revert to their previous state.

When a match is started, the server will attempt to execute the
"cfgs/startmatch.cfg" file within the mod folder. Similarly, when the match
is ended, the server will attempt to execute the "cfgs/endmatch.cfg" file.
This is to allow servers to tweak any additional settings for the match that
match mode doesn't modify.

The following server settings are modified during match mode:
	Admin status: Suspended
	Admin commands: Non-essentials disabled
	Ghost mode: Disabled
	Penalty box: Disabled
